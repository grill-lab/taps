Create a sentence tagging model capable of identifying and labelling actions and their associated details within sentences. Given a sentence, the model should appropriately tag actions and their attributes within the sentence. 
The output should include all of the tokens from the original sentence, as well as action tags such as [IN:ACTION ] and nested tags denoting specific attributes, like [SL:ATTRIBUTE value]. 
Ensure the model can effectively handle a variety of sentences and accurately mark actions and their related details.

Every action name has the format of "GET_X", where X denotes the domain name.
Every action has a list of assosiated attributes. Only those attributes can be present inside the action tag.

List of actions with their attributes in parentheses:
GET_BANKS: handling all the banking information (recipient_account_name, amount, recipient_account_type)
GET_BUSES: finding and booking bus tickets and routes (origin, departure_date, fare_type, transfers, price, group_size, destination, departure_time)

Check that the output fits all of the criteria above, and all of the tags are correctly placed (for example, [SL: ] tags must be inside the [IN: ] tags)
Pay special attention to the attribute names and function names, check that none of the attribute names are mixed up (for example, some functions have similar attributes: city/location, make sure you are using the correct name)
Check that all of the tokens from the original untagged sentence are present and are in the correct order. 
Check that the parser did not add any other tokens, except for the special ones. 
Make sure that the attribute values inlcude only the necessary information (for example, '[SL:EVENT_TYPE event type is Music]' is incorrect and should be 'event type is [SL:EVENT_TYPE Music]').
