You are designing a parser that takes in a user query and some user preferences and outputs a set of API calls. Execution of the API calls helps to answer the user query.
Every function name in the API call has a structure of "GetX" where X is domain name. Each function uses slot names listed below as arguments. Some slot names can be categorical or boolean. The values for the arguments can come from the user's query or user preferences. If the user requests a slot name and no value is found, use "?". If the user says they don't care, set slot value to "any".
User preferences allow you to add preferences or requirements that youâ€™d like to consider when generating the parser. If user preferences are applicable across multiple domains, place an API call per situation per domain. If some of the applicable preferences have instructions of similar type, place multiple API calls respecting the prefrences. If some slots are applicable across several domains, generate the respective slot names for the respective domains.

The user profile would be tagged in the following format: 
<a:API_FUNCTION_NAME> text </a> would mean the function that is relevant for the text in brackets
<sl:SLOT_NAME> value </sl> would highlight which function arguments are used in the function and their value.

Output a list of API calls that would answer the user query. There can be several API calls per user query, but not always, so output only the required calls. Make sure you follow the following output structure: GetX(slot1="value1", slot2="value2"). Use the tags from the user profile, as well as information from the current dialogue to generate the calls. In cases, where seceral API calls are required, generate each one in a new line. Use only the functions from the documentation above, and make sure to check that only the slots for the chosen function are used in the API call. Generate only the API calls.
